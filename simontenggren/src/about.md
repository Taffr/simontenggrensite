## I am a 23 year old Swedish Information and Communications Engineering Student with focus on Software Engineering currently studying my masters at LTH. 

# Software Development 
My language of choice is at the moment C. I like it because because ever since I took a course in writing efficient C code where I got apprication for the languages simplicity and how line of code is compiled. I also feel that I get to understand more of the compiler and the possible optimizations a good compiler can make, and those it can't. This has made me prefer compiled languages compared to
interpreted and managed run-time systems. And later made take a course in compiler technology.

I have also dabbled in machine learning, written several classifiers from scrath and applied neural networks in NLP, image classification, etc. 

I have worked in API development (Node) interacting with several other services, and developed web pages in React and PHP.


In my free time I like learning new tools I can use while developing new software, especially new datastructures.
# Hobbies
### Strength training with focus on Powerlifting.
I find that strength training clears my mind and clears my stress.
It also allows me find something to progress at outside of my studies, reading articles and books on strength training is something I do weekly and I love how that it allows me to apply this new knowledge to both improve my own and friends training results.

I have competed in a small Strongman competition and plan on competing in powerlifting in the future.
I currently train at Sundkraft Gym in Lund. (Best gym in Lund ;\) )

I collect Whisk(e)y when I can. I enjoy peaty notes such as those from Lagavulin 16, Ardbeg 10, Laphroaig 10, and other distilleries from Islay. But also enjoy some bourbon and smoother Scottish whiskies. I usually reward my hard work by buying a 

### Configuration
I like customizing my possessions so that they work and feel they way I want it to.

Examples including customizing my desktop for both aesthetic and productivity purposes. Writing my own scripts, shortcuts, downloading fonts, typesetting with Latex, etc.
Modding the games that I play, photoshopping images are also some things I do when I get time and need.
